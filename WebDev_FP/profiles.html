        <h2>Lisa Batiashvili</h2>
        <p>
          Lisa Batiashvili is a prominent Georgian violinist active across Europe and the United States. She is one of my favorite soloists due to her close attention to detail. Her violin is a Guarneri del Gesu, made in 1739 and is on loan from a private German collector. I first heard Lisa's recordings when I was much younger, and grew very attached to her sweet, clear tone and musical depth. Her technical brilliance is astonishing, but I feel that her attention to musical detail is what truly sets her aside from other prominent violinists.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Violin:</strong> Guarneri del Gesu (1739)</p>
        <p><strong>Lisa's Style:</strong> Elegant and lyrical with exceptional precision.</p>

        <h2>David Oistrakh</h2>
        <p>
          David Oistrakh was a true legend. Born in 1908 in what is now the Ukraine, Oistrakh became world famous because of his powerful and formidable performances. He possessed flawless technique and emotional depth that I have always admired. David left a lasting legacy in the music world and is still widely known among violinists today. David played many Stradivarius violins in his career, but perhaps the most famous was the "Marsick" violin which is now owned by another legend, James Ehnes.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Violin:</strong> Stradivarius (1715) "Marsick"</p>
        <p><strong>David's Style:</strong> Warm, rich, and compelling.</p>

        <h2>Leonidas Kavakos</h2>
        <p>
          Leonidas Kavakos is a Greek violinist whose wildly impressive technique has always captivated me. He is celebrated worldwide for his mastery and commanding stage presence. I had the chance to see him perform live when I was 16, which was an incredible experience for me. Kavakos plays a Stradivarius violin that was crafted in 1734.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Violin:</strong> Stradivarius 1734 "Willemotte"</p>
        <p><strong>Leonidas's Style:</strong> Brilliant and beautiful with incredible technique.</p>
